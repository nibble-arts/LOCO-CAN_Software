Assuming you don't care about the specific frequency, but just want it out of the audible range, you can easily get 31 kHz PWM on pin 9 and 10 (controlled by Timer1) and / or 11 and 3 (controlled by Timer2).
Code: [Select]


void setup() {
  // Set PWM frequency to 31 kHz for pin 9 and 10
  TCCR1B = TCCR1B & 0b11111000 | 1;
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(10, somevalue);
}
